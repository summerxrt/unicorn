### **Unicorn Project**

#### **Overview**
This project was created as a fun exploration into data analysis and visualization, focusing on magical unicorns ðŸ¦„. The goal was to analyze various unicorn-related data, including their migration speeds, horn lengths, and rainbow intensities, using the R programming language. The project also demonstrates the use of Git, GitHub, and R Markdown for data science and collaborative development.

#### **Purpose**
The unicorn project is meant to be a playful introduction to data analysis, where we explore fictional data such as unicorn migration patterns and their magical characteristics. It aims to showcase how you can apply data analysis techniques to even the most whimsical datasets, all while learning core programming skills in R.
